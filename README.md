Collection of python routines to work with astropy tables

The routines are written to be similar in behaviour to Topcat by Mark Taylor:
http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/
Some of the routines should even work with topcat crossmatch output tables
(as the groupsize and groupID columns are also used in a similar way)

Written in Python 3 (might not run in Python 2)

Requires: numpy, matplotlib, scipy, tqdm, astropy.
